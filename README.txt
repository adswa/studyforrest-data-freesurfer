High-resolution structural images were used to generate the cortical surfaces
using FreeSurfer (v5.3.0, freely available at http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu,
[Dale et al., 1999]). Additional high-resolution T2w images were included
in the reconstruction (recon-all -T2 t2file).

The surface quality was checked by inspecting the slice screenshots of QATool
(v1.1, freely available at http://ftp.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/QATools, [no
source paper linked]). The QATool was adopted to take sreenshots of the
high-resoluton pial surface.
